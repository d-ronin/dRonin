 * This has been calibrated 2015/12/06 using next @ f7f5c5ffe0a2b2fb9da819e32719f6b3bddacf86.
 * Calibration has been done by disabling the init task, breaking into debugger after
 * approximately after 60 seconds, then doing the following math:
 *
 * IDLE_COUNTS_PER_SEC_AT_NO_LOAD = (uint32_t)((double)idleCounter / vtlist.vt_systime * 1000 + 0.5)
 *
 * This has to be redone every time the toolchain, toolchain flags or RTOS
 * configuration like number of task priorities or similar changes.
 * A change in the cpu load calculation or the idle task handler will invalidate this as well.
