This is the TauLinkModule. It is inspired by the wonderful
work by pip a few years ago on the PipXtreme which was an
F1 processor with RFM22b module. This extends it to have
a layout that works in a JR module bay, has support for 
injecting information into the Taranis, and has a bluetooth
module for relaying the telemetry to android.

One thing that I don't love is the vertically mounted USB
connector that can be easily ripped off if one is not
careful, so be aware of that.

The schematic calls for a HM-10 BLE module, however I think
there is a footprint compatible module that is not BLE which
might be a good alternative if you want to connect to the
computer.
